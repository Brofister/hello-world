# hello-world

Hello world of IT!

I'm Denis, from Ukraine. I'm a newbie learner of Java. Actually, I've been learning it for 5-6 month now, but still gor a lot to learn and still have no idea what to make out of my knowledges. That's why I'm here, to learn and to apply knowledges in some practical exercices and solutions.
Hope to become a real programmer one day :d
Bye! Never give up x).
